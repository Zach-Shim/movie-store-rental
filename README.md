# Movie Rental Store
This program was created as a final project for the CSS 343 Data Structures and Algorithms class at University of Washington, Bothell

## To Do:
There are still a few bugs to work out such as storing borrowed transaction objects, storing Classic movie objects, as well as fixing output. Other than that, my program works exactly to specifications. The only thing that is not implemented is some of the copy constructors, which I included for extendability.

## Data Structures
A hash table stores clients based on a hashed key of their ID
Binary trees are used to store the three types of movies: Classic, Comedy, and Drama. I may switch it and store them using a hash table. It would only take finding that right hash algorithm for their storing requirements. 

## Reflection
This took me many hours over the course of a few weeks to complete. Even though relatively basic concepts of OOP, ineheritance and design are used,
I am proud of what I was able to accomplish. From requirement analysis, to design, architecture, and implementation and testing, it was a great project for my to learn more about C++
