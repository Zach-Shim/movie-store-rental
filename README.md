# Movie Rental Store
This program was created as a final project for the CSS 343 Data Structures and Algorithms class at University of Washington, Bothell

## To Do:
1. Fixing output for Classic movie inventory. 
2. Switch Movie object storage from bintrees to hashtable. It will only take finding the right hash key to avoid collisions since the hashtable is templated.
2. Implement copy constructors.
3. Find an alternative way to store borrowed and returned movies for clients.

## Data Structures
A hash table stores clients based on a hashed key of their ID
Binary trees are used to store the three types of movies: Classic, Comedy, and Drama. 

## Reflection
This took me many hours over the course of a few weeks to complete. Even though relatively basic concepts of OOP, ineheritance and design are used,
I am proud of what I was able to accomplish. From requirement analysis, to design, architecture, and implementation and testing, it was a great project for me to learn more about C++
